                <p>

                    I am a senior at the University of Michigan, pursuing a B.S.E. in Computer Science with a minor in Physics. 
                    I'm passionate about building technology that makes a difference, and I'm especially drawn to solving complex 
                    engineering problems at the intersection of software engineering, machine learning, artificial intelligence. 

                </p>

                <p>

                    I have extensive experience in Python, C++, SQL, API development, React, and Java, and have contributed to 
                    real-world projects, from building an object detection model for construction safety with YOLOv8 and PyTorch, 
                    to developing a convolutional neural network to detect various eye conditions as part of MIT's Medlytics course 
                    (for which I'm a teaching assistant now)!

                </p>
                
                <p>

                    Outside of tech, I enjoy video editing, driving fast cars, reading fiction and mystery novels, and trying new foods. 
                    And, if I ever get bored, I always have this website to improve further! I'm constantly seeking exciting, cutting-edge 
                    software engineering & AI/ML opportunities where I can grow, contribute, and make a real-world positive impact! 

                </p>

                <p>

                    I appreciate you stopping by! Feel free to <a href="contact.html" class="contact">connect</a> — I'm always open 
                    to chatting about technology, research, or the next great book to read!
